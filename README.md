# Texas Election Map Generator

A Javascript program designed to ease the process of creating county-by-county maps of elections in the state of Texas. It takes in multiples CSVs as inputs, applies them to BlankTexasCountyMap.svg, and deposits the completed map in the Finished_Maps folder. Example:
![alt text](https://github.com/Jurech/texas-election-map-generator/blob/main/BlankTexasCountyMap.svg?raw=true) ![alt text](https://github.com/Jurech/texas-election-map-generator/blob/main/Finished_Maps/2020Election.svg?raw=true)
The map on the right displays the results of the 2020 US Presidential Election in Texas.
